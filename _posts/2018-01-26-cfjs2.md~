title: Creole Forth for JavaScript, Part 2 
---

My previous post last week introduced Creole Forth for JavaScript. As of today I'm pleased to report significant progress. It has close to 70 words and is close
to its companion languages in out-of-the-box functionality. Below is a list of features that were implemented this week.
<ol>
<li>Colon compiler</li>
<li>IF-THEN-ELSE branching</li>
<li>BEGIN-UNTIL looping</li>
<li>Timing primitives</li>
<li>List compiler which allows a list of words to be passed as a single unit onto the stack</li>
<li>CREATE, DOES> and , (comma). DOES> doesn't work right yet inside a colon definition</li>
<li>@ and !</li>
<li>CONSTANT and VARIABLE. Since CONSTANT relies on DOES> do not use it yet in a colon definition.</li>
<li>DEFINITIONS - sets the context vocabulary to the current</li> 
<li>MSGBOX - takes a value off the stack and puts it in an alert box</li> 
<li>EVAL - evaluates raw JavaScript code. This is limited to alerts right now for security reason</li> 
<li>VLIST - outputs the dictionary as an HTML table</li>
</ol>
