title: Creole Forth for JavaScript 
---

I originally designed Creole Forth as a Delphi component that can be dropped onto a form. Later on I created a version of it to Excel where it exists as a couple of
spreadsheets combined with some VBA modules, classes, and forms. Can it be rebuilt in JavaScript? Click on the <a href="cfpage.html">link</a> to see my first attempt
at it. So far, it's just a bunch of primitives in a single JavaScript file with an outer and inner interpreter that can look them up and execute them.

Some words implemented:
<ol>
<li>HELLO - pops up a message box saying "Hello World".</li>
<li>+ : Adds two numbers on the stack. Make sure they're on there first.</li>
<li>-, *, /, % : other arithmetic operations. </li>
<li>DUP - duplicates a stack argument.</li>
<li>SWAP - swaps the top two stack args.</li>
<li>ROT - moves the third stack arg to the top.</li> 
<li>-ROT - moves the top stack arg to the third position.</li> 
<li>Over 20 others so far.</li> 
</ol>

Stay tuned. Based on my previous experience, about 70 primitives along with the colon interpreter and compiler is enough for a decent application base.
